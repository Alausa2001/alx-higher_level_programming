 You must use the module MySQLdb (import MySQLdb)
 Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
 Results must be sorted in ascending order by cities.id
 You can use only execute() once
 The results must be displayed as they are in the example below
 Your code should not be executed when imported
